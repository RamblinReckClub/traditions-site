                        <p>Kicking off the Football gameday is this time honored tradition. The road between Peters Parking Deck and various Tech greek life, or Brittain Drive NW,
                            is the location of Yellow Jacket Alley. Ramblin Reck Club members, Band, Spirit, and Colorguard form a sort of tunnel for the team to
                            go through. Then a procession lead by the Reck, followed by Buzz, the drumline, and the football team will walk through. Lastly, when the Reck gets
                            to the end it will make a turn up Freshman Hill and everyone will collapse in behind the football team to close out Yellow Jacket Alley. This is a fantastic experience and a great way to start off what is always a memorable
                            and beloved day watching our Jackets play ball.</p>

                        <p>Next on the list of exhilirating events pre gameday is watching the beloved Reck drive down Freshman Hill (Bobby Dodd Way NW). Flanked by members of the Ramblin
                            Reck Club and followed by the band playing iconic Georgia Tech fight songs, this is always a great way to get pumped for gameday and to also get a close look
                            at one of the most memorable mascots in all of college sports! The procession is usually led by two police escorts, and after driving down the hill, the 
                            Reck will speed up and make the right turn into the Stadium. The Reck is then followed by the enthusiastic Ramblin Reck Club members as they also run into the Stadium
                            following the Reck.

                        <p>One of, if not the most iconic entrance in college football is something you can not miss. The Reck, as it has ever since September 30, 1961, leads the football
                            team out on the field to the cheers of fans as they excitedly wait for their Yellow Jackets to take the field and pummel their opponent.

                        <p>There are usually two fight songs that fans chant after the Yellow Jackets score a touchdown. Immediately after the touchdown,
                            fans chant one of our fight songs: "Up With the White and Gold", but remember to quiet down near the end to make sure our kicker
                            has all the silence to make the point after try! After that, once the kicker makes the point after kick, the fans chant
                            the iconic "Ramblin Wreck From Georgia Tech" fight song, followed by a repetitive Go Jackets! chant. Hopefully you'll get to those
                            a bunch throughout the game!</p>

                        <p>If you are in the Swarm Student Section, congrats! You get to experience being inside making the Flag what it is. Usually right
                            before the third quarter, Ramblin Reck Club members toss down a large flag over the student section, and the student underneath jump
                            and hit the flag causing it to have a wavy formation that looks very cool from the outside, and is very fun from the inside. After a couple of
                            minutes of it waving to show off our GT pride, it quickly gets unfurled down to other members of the Ramblin Reck Club to be
                            taken safely to storage.</p>

                        <p>One of the most popular traditions at Georgia Tech is the Budweiser Song. 
                            The song was at one point played multiple times through football games, but is now played between the 3rd and 4th quarters of every football game – taking the place of the song Dixie. 
                            It was originally written by Steve Karmen and became popular after it was heard in a Budweiser commercial. During the song, it is tradition for all the Georgia Tech fans to bob up and down throughout the song.
                             Make sure to get next to some friends and alternate bobbing up and down!</p>

                        <p>If you stay long enough after the end of the game, the entire event is ended by the Band's playing of "The Horse". While the event starts off very calm,
                            with the band playing a fun tune and people dancing along to it, the craziness happens between the first and second verse of the song. Fans and Band Members run
                            and try to spread out as far as they can (or for some reason get as high up in the stadium as they can) before the band starts playing the second verse of the song,
                            upon which everyone starts dancing to the tune again. Win or lose, this is an extremely fun experience and one you should never miss if given the chance.</p>
