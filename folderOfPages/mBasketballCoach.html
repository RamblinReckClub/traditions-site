            <p>Josh Pastner, a Texas native, came to Georgia Tech after seven successful years as the head coach of the Memphis men’s basketball team. Pastner started his coaching career as a graduate-assistant under Arizona coach Lute Olson in 2000. From 2002 to 2008, he served as an assistant coach on Arizona’s basketball team. After one year as an assistant coach at the University of Memphis, he finally earned his first head coaching position in 2009. Pastner is known for his recruiting prowess, and in 2010, he succeeded in recruiting one of the top recruitment classes in the nation. In his seven years at Memphis, he led the Tigers to five postseasons and an overall 167-73 record.</p>
            <p>On April 8th, 2016, Pastner became the 14th basketball head coach at Georgia Tech. In his first year at Tech, his team was projected to finish last in the division with no conference wins, but a 8-10 finish in the ACC resulted in him being named the ACC Coach of the Year. In the same year, the Yellow Jackets were selected for the National Invitation Tournament (NIT), in which they ended up becoming the runner-up behind Texas Christian University (TCU). Josh Pastner has seen plenty of coaching success in his career and he hopes to further it even more as he continues his tenure at Tech.</p>
