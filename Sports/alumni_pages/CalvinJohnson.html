            <p>The Georgia Tech football team has a past filled with great success and great adversity. However, among these great accomplishments, Calvin Johnson stands out. Johnson was born in Newnan, Georgia, and as a six foot tall middle schooler, his athletic abilities were apparent. He came to Georgia Tech and played from 2004 until 2006.</p>
            <p>In his freshman season, he was named ACC Freshman of the Year and set the school record for receiving yards. He was then named an All-American in 2005 and 2006. He was first team All-ACC in 2004, 2005, and 2006, and he was the ACC Player of the Year in 2006. By the time he left Tech, he held six school records: receiving yards, touchdown receptions, and 100-yard receiving games in a career and a season. He was recently selected to be in Sports Illustratedâ€™s Top 150 College Football Players of All Time and was inducted into the College Football Hall of Fame.</p>
            <p>He also went on to have a successful professional career. He was drafted by the Detroit Lions in the first round as the second overall pick in the 2007 NFL draft. He spent nine seasons with the Detroit Lions before his retirement in 2015. During that time, he led the NFL in receiving yards for two seasons, and he still holds the NFL record for the most single-season receiving yards. Calvin Johnson was an incredibly skilled football player who will forever be remembered as one of the best players to don the Georgia Tech uniform.</p>
